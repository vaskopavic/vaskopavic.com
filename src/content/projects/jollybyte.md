Welcome to Jollybyte, where the fun of fast food goes digital. We had a blast working on this site, making sure every click and scroll has as much flavor as the food itself.

This was a real team effort. [Nathalie Talevska](https://nathalietalevska.com) set the playful vibe with her design, while [Marko Spasenovski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marko-spasenovski/) and I focused on bringing everything to life with code — making sure it was interactive and easy to use. We wanted Jollybyte to feel as fun and inviting online as it would in person.

There were definitely some challenges along the way, but working through them just made the project even more satisfying. Seeing Jollybyte come together, piece by piece, reminded us just how much you can do when creativity and teamwork come together. Go ahead, check it out — this is Jollybyte, one pixel at a time!
