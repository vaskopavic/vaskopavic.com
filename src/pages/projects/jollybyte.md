Welcome to the Jollybyte project! As a developer, this was an exhilarating journey that pushed our skills to the limit. We embarked on this adventure during a 5-day ReactJS workshop, and let me tell you, it was a whirlwind of creativity, coding, and collaboration.

Working alongside my talented teammates, [Natali Talevska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natali-talevska/) (the designer extraordinaire) and [Marko Spasenovski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marko-spasenovski/) (the brilliant developer), we set out to bring the fictitious fast-food chain, Jollybyte, to life on the web. The pressure was on, but we thrived on the challenge.

Each day brought new challenges, but we tackled them head-on, leveraging our problem-solving skills and staying true to industry best practices. As we neared the end of the workshop, the adrenaline peaked, and we polished every pixel and line of code.

In the end, our hard work paid off, and we proudly claimed the first-place win. It was a testament to our dedication, passion, and seamless teamwork.
